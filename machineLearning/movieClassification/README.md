# **Movie Classification**

### **GOAL**

The goal of this project is to  classify movies using  various features.

### **DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here]().

### **WHAT I HAVE DONE**
- Step 1: Data Exploration
- Step 2: Data Visualization
- Step 3: Data Training & Model Creation
- Step 4: Performance Evaluation

### **LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn (For data traning, importing models and performance check)

### **Accuracy of different models used**
- By using Naive Bayes model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  56.44
 ``` 
- By using KNN model 
 ```python
    Accuracy achieved :  60.40
 ``` 

### **Conclusion**

- For this project i.e. Movies classification we have used two classification algorithms that are Naive Bayes and KNN using same training and testing data.

- The accuracy of KNN model is higher than that of Naive bayes model.

- The error for KNN model is lower than that of Naive bayes model.

- We can conclude that KNN is more effiecient classification algorithm than Naive Bayes algorithm.
