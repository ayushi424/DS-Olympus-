# **Diabetes Prediction with ML Models**


**GOAL**

- The goal of this exercise is to identify the parameters that influences the diabetes attack and build a ML model for the prediction of diabetes attack.


**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

By using Logistic Regression I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of  Logistic Regression = 73.4375
 ``` 

By using Random Forest Classifier I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of Random Forest =  73.4375
 ``` 
 
 By using Decision Tree Classifier I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of Decision Tree =  67.70833333333334
 ``` 
 
  By using  Support Vector Classifier I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of Support Vector Machine =  73.4375
 ``` 
 
  By using  KNeighborsClassifier I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of KNeighborsClassifier =  70.83333333333334
 ``` 
 
  By using GradientBoostingClassifier I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of GradientBoostingClassifier   =  76.5625
 ``` 
 
 
  By using XGBClassifier I got 
 ```python
    test accuracy score of XGBClassifier =  75.0
 ```
