# **Dogecoin Price Prediction**
Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a joke, making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time.
- Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate investment prospect.
- Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" meme as its logo and namesake.
